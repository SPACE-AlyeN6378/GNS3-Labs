<svg width="1236" height="264"><text font-family="TypeWriter" font-size="10.0" font-weight="bold" fill="#000000" fill-opacity="1.0">- All IP addresses have been preconfigured for you.
The following loopback interfaces have been configured:
HongKong: 1.1.1.1 /24
Amsterdam: 2.2.2.2 /24
Barcelona: 3.3.3.3 /24
HongKong: Configure OSPF  (process-id 1) and advertise all networks by using a single network statement. Use area0
Amsterdam: Configure OSPF (process-id 1) and advertise all networks by using 2 network statements, area0.
Barcelona: Configure OSPF (process-id 1) and advertise all networks by using 3 network statements, area0.
Optional: the loopback interfaces appear as /32’s in the routing table, make sure they appear as /24’s just as you configured them.
Amsterdam: change the router-id to 22.22.22.22, make sure you see this change from Barcelona by using show commands.
Traffic from Barcelona to HongKong should use the link between Amsterdam-Barcelona, use the cost command to achieve this.
Remove the previous change with the cost-command, achieve the same goal by using the bandwidth command.
Enable clear-text authentication between Amsterdam and HongKong. Use “vault” as a password.
Enable MD5 authentication between Barcelona and HongKong. Use “Safe” as a password.
Change the OSPF timers on the link between Amsterdam and Barcelona so hello packets are being sent every 5 seconds.
The HongKong router will have access to the Internet in the future, you need to advertise a default route in OSPF so Amsterdam and Barcelona will send traffic for unknown networks to HongKong.</text></svg>
